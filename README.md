# Forced Move

A calm, strategy-first twist on Tic-Tac-Toe.

Play classic Tic-Tac-Toe or a nested variant where every move constrains your opponent's next move. You do not choose where to play — your opponent does.

Win small boards to claim space on the main board. Align three to win the game.

Designed for thoughtful play, not speed.
