# Forced Move
![Intro screen showing the “Enter the game” overlay on a chalkboard illustration](public/intro.jpg)

Forced Move is a take on Tic-Tac-Toe where the rules constrain what comes next. Each move reshapes the space of possible moves that follow, rewarding foresight over fast reactions. Inspired by mathematical game structures, strategy here comes from understanding constraints rather than racing to click.

## A quick story

I first learned about this family of games while reading Ben Orlin’s *Math with Bad Drawings*, where he mentions mathematicians in Berkeley getting hooked on an “ultimate” Tic-Tac-Toe played across nested boards. Forced Move is my homage to that tale: a calm, mobile-friendly way to play the same idea with friends or the computer. ***What's fascinating about this is how simple rules quietly force deep strategy.*** 
 

## Play it

- **Solo vs CPU:** You can play single player mode against 5 levels of difficulty. 
- **With a friend:** Create a game and share the game id and token with a friend so that they can join. 
- **Accessible controls:** There are dark/light modes and a warm and cool colour pallette to toggle between.
